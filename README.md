[![Unit Tests](https://github.com/xieyonn/blink-cmp-dat-word/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/xieyonn/blink-cmp-dat-word/actions/workflows/test.yaml)

Fast, offline word source for [blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp). Pure Lua, no other dependencies.

## Features

- Fast
    - Use [Double-Array Tire](https://linux.thai.net/~thep/datrie/datrie.html) data structure to build the word completion source, with query time < 0.1 ms.
    - Use binary file for serialization, only rebuilt when the word source file is updated.
- Async: All operations are performed asynchronously and will never block.

## Requirements

- neovim >= v0.11.0
- [blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp)

## Quick Start

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
return {
  {
    "saghen/blink.cmp",
    dependencies = {
      "xieyonn/blink-cmp-dat-word",
    },
    opts = {
      sources = {
        default = {
          -- ...
          "datword", -- add datword to default sources
        },
        providers = {
          -- add datword provider
          datword = {
            name = "DatWord",
            module = "blink-cmp-dat-word",
            opts = {
              paths = {
                -- "path_to_your_words.txt", -- add your owned word files before dictionary.
                "/usr/share/dict/words", -- This file is included by default on Linux/macOS.
              },
              build_command = "" -- Define a Command to rebuild words, eg: `BuildDatWord`, then use `BuildDatWord!` to force rebuild.
            },

            -- max_items = 20, -- Maximum number of words queried per request.
            -- score_offset = -10, -- Set a lower priority.
            -- min_keyword_length = 2,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

> Query words in order of `opts.paths`, add custom words file before dictionary files.

## Word Source Files

Recommends:

- [Google-10000-english](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english) 10k most common English words.
- `/usr/share/dict/words` is a standard system file on Unix-like OSes containing a large list of English words, one per line.

Or add your own word list, with one word per line.
